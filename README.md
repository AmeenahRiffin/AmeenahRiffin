## You've discovered Ameenah Riffin's Github

Hello from the other side of the screen. I'm Ameenah, an aspiring DevOps/Software Engineer. Tech is definitely a bit of a journey of endless learning and discovery, and one I've enjoyed for a few years now.
This Github is a bit like an attic right now, full of dusty (and new) study projects and ideas I've been working on.

Hoping to expand my range of projects as things go on, but for now enjoy your stay.
